#Who we are

Over the years, a number of people have contributed to DataSF and the City’s Open Data Policy.

The existing open data portal has been maintained by Andy Maimoni and Mathias Gibson at 311. The GIS team, Jeff Johnson and Sam Valdez, create and maintain the backend data feeds to DataSF. Jay Nath and Jason Lallly in the Mayor’s Office of Civic Innovation provide guidance and support.  And are summer intern, Peri Weisberg, is helping on a number of projects.

My name is Joy Bonaguro and I joined in late February as the city’s first Chief Data Officer.

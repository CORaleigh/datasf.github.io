<p>Today we released the new DataSF. You spoke and we listened. Our new design addresses some of the major usability issues on our website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simplifying the category structure (we went from 27 to 10 categories) to improve data discovery</li>
  <li>Making it easy to find data by department (for those familiar with the City)</li>
  <li>Visually integrating the various pages so it felt like you were on the same website</li>
  <li>Simpler, more intuitive and visual help</li>
  <li>Quick tips on accessing the API and getting started</li>
  <li>Adding an about page with links to our strategic plan and reports</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multiple ways to discover data</h2>
<p>Based on feedback from both internal and external users - we really wanted to make sure we offered several ways of discovering our data. The following three already existed, but we made some improvements:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>By search. </b>We already offered this, but we made the feature more prominent.</li>
  <li><b>By category.</b> Our old design made our categories hard to use or even find. They are now featured prominently in the new design.</li>
  <li><b>By type of dataset.</b> This is a standard Socrata feature, but our new data catalog makes it more intuitive and presents the differences as a conscious choice.</li>
</ol>
<p>And then we added one more based on hearing again and again how frustrating it was to find data from departments: <b>By department.</b>
</p>
<h2>A few more details on categories</h2>
<p>We spent some time thinking about the categories. And we used a bunch of tools to try and identify the right mix of categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Survey of categories on existing sites.</b> We reviewed categories from major open data websites, both local, national and international. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ih3x4uEu5VvRUEw7PaeSt2wqw0WrHuj01pSnV1EM2d8/edit?usp=sharing">Review the survey here</a> (gdoc).</li>
  <li><b>Analysis of search terms.</b> Our major finding here was the need to have a category for geographic boundaries.</li>
  <li><b>Card sorting!</b> This helped us move some of our data around and find new clusters of data.</li>
  <li><b>User interviews.</b> We asked end users to respond to our categories and tell us what sounded like bureaucratic speak. We tried to remove bureaucratic speak...</li>
</ul>
<p>While this job will never be done, we think we’ve vastly improved it.</p>
<h2>Future Steps</h2>
<p>But we still have more to do. Look for future improvements to include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easier distinction between original (or source) dataset and derived views, charts, and maps</li>
  <li>Improved metadata</li>
  <li>Simpler chart creation</li>
</ul>
<p>And a huge thanks to the development team at Socrata - Lou Huang and Louis Fettet. With a special shout out to Jessica Carsten for shepherding this project.</p>
<p>And we look forward to working with you, the user, to make DataSF a delightful experience!</p>
